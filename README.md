# Eagles-vs-Hawks
This is my very first Computer Vision project that I made using fast.ai and PyTorch. 
I understood the concepts and functioning of the code from the first lesson of the Practical Deep Learning for Coders Course.

After training the model using Resnet18 Architecture, it achieved an accuracy of 97.7%
